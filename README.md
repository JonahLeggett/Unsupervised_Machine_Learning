# Unsupervised_Machine_Learning
This is a jupyter notebook that clusters cryptocurrencies by their performance over different time periods. It also plots the results so that you can visualize the performance. This project cluster's cryptocurrencies with K-means algorithm, it finds the Best Value for k, optimizes the clusters with Principal Component Analysis, and finally visualize's the results using scatter plots.

## Technologies

This project leverages python 3.7 with the following packages:


* [pandas1.2.4](https://pandas.pydata.org) - Open source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming language.

* [hvplot.pandas](https://hvplot.holoviz.org/user_guide/Pandas_API.html) - A high-level plotting API for the PyData ecosystem built on HoloViews.

* [sklearn.cluster](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html) - Clustering of unlabeled data can be performed with the module sklearn.cluster.

* [sklearn.decomposition](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.PCA.html) - Principal component analysis (PCA) is used for linear dimensionality reduction using Singular Value Decomposition of the data to project it to a lower dimensional space.

* [sklearn.preprocessing](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/preprocessing.html) - The sklearn.preprocessing package provides several common utility functions and transformer classes to change raw feature vectors into a representation that is more suitable for the downstream estimators.
